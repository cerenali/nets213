## HIT Code (for both crowdsourcing labels and quality control)

The Quality Control HIT code is an HTML file that was generated by the Amazon Mechanical Turk graphical interface for designing a HIT. The main (crowdsourcing labels) HIT consists mostly of text, with two drop-down fields and a text input. All three must be filled out for the worker to be able to submit; the information is subsequently collected by Amazon MTurk into a CSV file that can be downloaded when the HITs have been completed. The quality control HIT is very similar, but instead of three questions, it only has one drop-down field, with the possible answers coming from the top two worker-picked answers of the previous (main) HIT.
