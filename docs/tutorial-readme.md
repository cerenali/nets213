# Step-By-Step Guide

## Contributing to the main HIT

Our main HIT asks workers to read a tweet and evaluate whom it is appropriate and not for, then enter a creative label of their own for the intended audience of the tweet.

1. Go to the Amazon Mechanical Turk site and search for HITs containing the word "Tweet". Select the one by John Hewitt, titled "Label the intended audience of a tweet", and click "View a HIT in this group" to view a HIT. For a direct link to the HIT group, click [here](https://www.mturk.com/mturk/preview?groupId=3S8DC08I1IMFWP4OJ5E0UE44QCWJE4)
2. Make sure to click the "Accept HIT" button **before** working on the HIT.
3. For each HIT, read the displayed tweet and select the best answer for each of the drop-down questions, then enter a label for an intended or possible audience of the weet in the text box below. Try to get as specific as possible while still remaining accurate; for example, most tweets could probably be appropriate for "general internet community" (one of the options in the drop-down list), but if it's appropriate for a more niche community (such as "coworkers"), please pick the more specific answer.
4. Repeat for as many HITs as you want to complete.

## Contributing to the quality control HIT (not up yet)

The quality control HIT has the same format and appearance as the main HIT â€” that is, you won't be able to tell until you are completing the actual HIT that it's different from the main HIT. The difference is that instead of asking the worker to answer 2 questions and input a label of their own creation, the worker is asked to choose which one of two labels best describes whom the tweet is appropriate for. (These two labels will be decided based on the top two labels chosen from the main HIT.)
